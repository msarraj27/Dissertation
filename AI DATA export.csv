Needs to be on 1.319 AND DevelopDL April 3: Needs to PR onto 1.318 for April 5 deployment. Also needs to be on Develop for Alpha testing.ÿDescription:Logic which was implemented in US6694169 to change how we're creating billing scheduled for Producer records which have a compensation type of Service Fee. ÿThe Billing Schedule is being created using the sysBillingDefaultValue information which has the given CarrierID, situsState, revenue arrangement, contract option type, date range, and billing calc method. ÿBasics isn't always sending the situs state in the AOR feed which is causing failures. ÿÿTo fix this issue, when the AOR feed doesn't contain the situs state we will be deriving situs state from the Contract Option with the same Contract Option Type (in the AOR feed for the producer) and which overlaps the Producer's effective date. ÿIf no contract options overlap the producer's effective date, use the contract option which is closest to the producer effective date.ÿSteps to reproduce:Create Member Group with Contract and active Contract Options in Cirrus.Post Basics payload/AOR Feed to kafka instance that Producer updates are posted topayload should have a compensation Type = 'Service Fee' AND does not have a situs state in the payloadExpected Result:MemGroupContractProducer records are successfully created using the information in the Basics payload and the identified Contract Option's situs state.ÿActual Result:MemGroupContractProducer records are not created and ERR891051 is logged in the Member Group Error Queue.ÿÿAdditional Information:Please confirm whether the producer assignment kafka service is up and running on your end in Alpha. We?ve been trying to make sf changes in Basics that aren?t feeding through.ÿIt?s also behaving strangely. Typically, when we send a sf update, there are two records populated in the Producer tab.

DE861094,Data Remediation | Populate Missing Coc Year on Plan Options,"PO: Tajoura (TJ) DavisSA: Sonali PereiraPR: https://github.com/uhc-tech-employer-individual/cirrus-apps_cirrus-core/pull/2085ÿÿJob Info:ÿJOBID: MGCPOCOC - all tenant jobLogger Result message format: {number of plan opt ids updated} Plan Options Updated, {number of plan opt ids failed} Plan Options Failed To Update MemGroupContractPlanOptIDs: {failed plan opt ids}ÿIssue Description:Users were previously unable to manually validate groups in Cirrus via the UI as they were getting a CoC error on the pop-up UI. Users are now able to pick the CoC Year manually but the volume of impacted groups is high enough for data remediation to be needed.ÿBusiness Requirements:ÿAs the Cirrus system, I need to be able to assign the CoC year from the benefit plan via a data remediation one-time job for groups where the value is required (Oxford FI, UHOPS LF, UHC FI) in the CoC year field of the plan option in to make the value available for the selection of benefits and fulfillment documents downstream.Once the data remediation is run, generate a report of all the plan options where CoC year should have been populated but was not.The job should be able to be run again as needed, potentially every year. This is because Oxford groups are manually built in Cirrus and CoC year is the last thing added to a plan option. The CoC year selected needs to be most recent/relevant at the time that the group is renewed and this is not known by Case Install at the time of renewal since groups renew up to 3 months in advance.Once the job is created, TJ will create a business process to have the Renewal Team submit an incident ticket when the job needs to be run in future.Data Remediation Logic (to be performed in all environments):Get memGroupContractPlanOption records where CoC year is NOT populated (includes logically deleted records).Of those identified, get plan options tied to a Medical contract option.Check if the group/plan option should be excluded, skip populating CoC year for excluded groups. Below are the criteria for excluded groups:TUFTS - a TUFTS plan option will have memGroupContractPlanOption.sellingCarrierID IN (1190006, 1221264, 1221265, 1221365)Oxford ASO - The base benefit plan associated to the plan option will have revenueArrangement = 04 (ASO) or 06 (ASO with Stoploss). To get the benefitPlan associated to the memGroupContractPlanOption, use memGroupContractPlanOption.<benefitBundleID>.<benefitBundleOptionID>.<benefitPlanID highest active version>.revenueArrangement.Surest - The base benefit plan associated to the plan option will have externalPlanInd = 1 (TRUE) for a Surest plan.If a plan option was NOT part of excluded groups, get the base benefit plan associated to the plan option, then get the CoC year from the record on beneCOCYear where beneCOCYear.benefitPlanVersionID = benefitPlan.benefitPlanVersionID and beneCOCYear timeline overlaps the memgroupContractOption.effectiveDate.ÿderive ÿplan yearplan year = renewal date - 1 year, if contract opt length <= 12 monthsplan year = Contract opt eff date, if contract opt length > 12 monthsThe derived plan year should be between COC effective and Expiration date, then update the plan option COC yearÿAssumptions:Groups that do not require this update (Surest ASO/FI/LF, Tufts, Oxford ASO) will be skipped when the job is run.ÿÿMGIDINC1618035INC36045591584374INC360448001612031INC360462261510442INC360300611270313ÿ1644283INC360307391417718INC360290571612031INC360462261530113INC360447341584374INC360448001646688INC360097041494096INC360491451510076ÿ1510459ÿ1517958ÿ1510143ÿ1395403ÿ1596550ÿ1620377ÿ1430127ÿÿ",QIB - Rogue,20-03-2024,Open,2-Major Problem,,,Customer Reported,,,,Russell Hammond,inconsistent timing in CoC Year being available on the benefit plan and the group renewal occurring,2024.PI49.2,In-Progress,

In the case of the other 2 members (43732484, 125952190), they should have been triggered once the PCP was added based off the stateMandatePcPReq Rule Set. I found a few issues with our call to the rule service engine located in the MemberIDCardRuleImpl. We are only sending memGroupConractOpt.situsState and memberAddress.state when making the query which will never return a true result; all AND fields below are needed.The rule fields seem to be case sensitive, and our situsState constant being used is """"SITUSSTATE"""" so again it will never return a true result unless case correct.

This is in accordance with Scenario 7 in US5727238. According to the notes: ÿ""""If the city name is a valid city name in Cirrus, and it's entered with a zip code that's also valid but does not align [ie.

St Louis, MO and St Paul, MN do not exist today in the zipcode table in the database, therefore, the code should take this into consideration and update the city name based off of the city/state/zip logic.

Creating this defect after discussion with Dave to find the root cause from IT perspective and resolve this issue permanently.ÿSome of the reported incidents are - INC34720330, INC34720465, INC34717943, INC34718172, INC34718235 & INC 34718068.ÿExample memberIDs - 164037220, 164422495, 164179074, 164179080, 164361825, 164422481, 164422486, 164067826, 164341354, 164057807, 164078060, 164179480, 164503714, 164513911, 163954252.Please note that I have released the hold from backend for these members as of now. There are more incidents and members that I am working on to release the hold.ÿOpened PRB1420810 ÿfor this.ÿÿÿI was able to get the python script to pull all impacted members that have MBRMAT hold but are not present in enrlmnt error queue . I see 600+ of such members as of today and this is after I already cleared many from yesterday. ÿThe count could be more since I am pulling this from Snowflake database (not directly from Cirrus)ÿExample members attachedÿÿ",Heimdalls,06-12-2023,Submitted,2-Major Problem,Production,,Internally Reported,PRB1420810,,,Dave Haas,,,Refining,

DE809351,Fix flaky MemberBenefitInsuringRuleServiceSpec which may be system-date-sensitive to failure,"The following test was found failing in Develop as of 11/29/23 and so was ignored. This needs attention particularly in the event that the root cause may be the system date and revealing a use case indicative of a real production defect. It of course may also just be the test itself that is flawed. Certainly any test that fails based on the date/time that it is run has a weakness to improve upon regardless.ÿÿThis test was failed on 11/29/2023, we set birthdate 92 days away (2/29/2024) minus 26 years, should be 02/29/1998, but 1998 only have 28 days in Feb. The birthday actually was set to 02/28/1998, after 26 years, the birth day 02/28/2024 is exactly 91 days away from today, so the OAD maxed out, changed to 99 days to make sure not max out.

DE806256,PROD | Contract Termination Incorrectly Deleting MemGroupContractMigration,"SA: Anne Roeber / Rishi KardamPO: Nancy McphersonPR: DE806256: MemGroupContractMigration Termination Logic FixÿIssue Description:When a member group contract is terminated, its existing contract migration records are always being logically deleted. This should only occur when the termination date is before the migration contract option effective date but this is not currently happening, resulting in incorrectly logically deleted contract migration records.During the contract termination process, contract option validation occurs, which systematically creates a new contract migration record. Then, when the contract is reinstated, the original logically deleted contract migration records are reinstated, resulting in duplicate records.ÿSteps to recreate:Create a member group contract with active contract options.A contract migration record is systematically added upon contract option validation (implemented in US5664708).Terminate the contract where the termination date is after the migration contract option effective date.The existing contract migration record is systematically logically deleted.Reinstate the contract.Expected Result:Migration contract record should not be logically deleted upon termination.No duplicate contract migration records exist upon reinstatement.ÿActual Result:Migration contract record is logically deleted upon termination.Duplicate contract migration records exist.ÿAdditional Information:TCR support for memGroupContractMigration was originally implemented in US5612769.Duplicate records existing on memGroupContractMigration will causes duplicates on extracts.ÿRequirements:Update the contract and contract option termination process to correctly handle the termination of memGroupContractMigration records.Only terminate (logically delete) memGroupContractMigration records when termination date is before the migContractOptEffDate.Run data remediation in all environments to delete duplicate contract migration records from the memGroupContractMigration table (via V99* file).Out of Scope:Member Group Contract Affiliation Termination, Contract Option Cancellation / Reinstatement (future enhancement)A script to handle incorrectly logically deleted records will be handled through support via INC35657714.ÿ",QIB - Rogue,21-11-2023,Open,2-Major Problem,Production,Design/Code Change,Internally Reported,,INC35657714,,Logan Fabyanske,US5612769,2024.PI48.3,Accepted,16-02-2024

Trying to load 17 Days.Surest group requesting a 17 custom rehire waiting period. But Cirrus is generating an error saying 17 days is invalid. An INC was submitted and the IT resource said the only values allowed are 30, 45, 60, 90 - the implementation of a day restriction should not have been implemented for custom insuring rules.

Membership is not being moved to the new location, in this case population, and is also not generating an error for why the membership is not moving. Example group below was sent to move 21 subscribers to different population placements based on benefits totaling 45 population updates. In Cirrus the initial match count shows 45 to match the sheet but only 7 are attempted and only 6 moved with 1 fail. In the error queue the one member failing has an error """"Member move failed. Please contact your system administrator."""" We have just over 4100 members that failed to move using the member move/matrix file for the 1/1 cycle and most look like they are due to this same issue when I look at the group. Please see attached matrix file as a sample of the file sent to move membership along with Cirrus Screenshots and Error Screenshots Product entered by customer: CirrusÿRoot problem is 2-fold:The member is failing to get a coverage population, when this happens we apply a COVPOP hold. This hold is attempting to add using effective date as todays date, but the member's affiliation is future dated. This logic needs to be updated to ensure the COVPOP hold is within the SA timeline, or bypass validation.When the COVPOP hold fails, we attempt to put the member on an MMUE hold. This includes a low level check in the abstract hold logic for no overlapping holds, which is incorrectly identifying a previously closed MMUE hold since it is technically overlapping for 1 day (the first day of the SA timeline). If member move fails to add a MMUE hold, this is treated as a catastrophic failure and the rest of the move is aborted and not attempted. The overlap check needs to be updated to exclude records where releasedInd is true to ensure the new hold can be added appropriately.",Ronin,24-10-2023,Closed,3-Minor Problem,,,Customer Reported,32489b06874efd5083622178dabb35cf,,Incident,Aaron Gorman,,2023.PI47.3,Accepted,09-11-2023

So memGroupContractMigration table has incorrect records. We also need to see if there are groups where we missed creating the correct records because of the multiple external IDs. We also need to check to make sure that the heavyweight logic that adds records to the migration table is correct. For example, are there any problems with groups that have 2 memGroupExternalIDs?ÿOpening this INC to correct what seems to be an issue with how the Cirrus Member Group Contract Migration Table and UI is pulling records from previous Contracts.ÿCirrus MG ID: 1324392Issue Description:ÿThe Cirrus Member Group Contract Migration UI appears to have 4 records displayed in Prod --> two of which have an Original Source System Type of PRIME and Two of which have a Original Source System of PULSE.ÿ This particular group was setup and migrated with a PULSE Medical Contract, which was Cancelled.ÿ Additionally, the group had Dental and Vision on PRIME which recently migrated and created a new Contract and new Dental and Vision Contract Options.ÿThe table under this new Contract should only display the Dental and Vision Contract Option Types with an Original Source System Type = PRIME, the old PULSE details should not reflect.ÿQuestions that can most likely be answered by Kyle Bender:1.

When you look up the same error in the old queue though, memberEnrollmentErrorQueue.queueItemStatus remains = 1 while the memberEnrollmentErrorQueueDtl.queueItemDetailStatus = 5. There seems to be a disconnect in the old queue statuses - see below. Jeff has confirmed that in prod the Queue Item Status should be set to 'Closed' when Queue Detail Status = Bulk Closed. Kamal and I tested the bulk close 'Close' and 'Close All' actions directly within the old queue (Member Enrollment Error Queue) and those are working as expected, setting the Queue Item Status to 'Closed'.

Attribute Derivation Schedule ID field required even though the group does not have an Enrollment Profile Set ID, custom attributes, or memGroup External IDs. Logic is checking SysMemGroupSetting for EnrollProfileSet and it is present in Production and logic then requires Attribute Derivation ScheduleID to be required. ÿIn addition, when a group has some members that need derivation and others that do not, the schedule shouldn't be required.ÿThe change made from this defect is to ease the validation and not make the Attribute Derivation Schedule required when available.ÿNotes:Its combination of code changes and current settings ? shown below is the Enroll profile set that is being picked up .ÿCode changes done in DE714346 removes the limitation on mg ext ID and looks at EPS at system level ? so between these code changes and sysMemGroupSettings/enroll profile set ÿits causing the breaking change.ÿDescription from defect:?The new Derivation Lookup includes a limitation that only looks at External ID's for a MG. ÿThis limitation needs to be removed and hot fixed as soon as possible?ÿFrom commit message: ?Changes are made to find all Attribute Derivation schedules that a member group can use.ÿ It will grab all Derivation Schedules from and EPS assigned at the MemGroupSettings level as well as all System Level Derivation schedules where the Group satisfies the source identifiers.?ÿNow with the code changes when there is no memGroup External IDs and no memGroupSettings for EPS it does a lookup in enrollProfSetView using a default source Identifier value of UINT and the and the enroll profile set ID defined at systemMemGroupSettings and returns a record. As a result of returning this value it sets the display logic on member guided entry to require attribute derivation schedule IDÿRecord returned from enrollProfSetView:enrollProfSetVersionIDenrollProfSetIDlockedMemGroupIDsetStatusenrollProfSetSchedAssignIDenrollAttribDerivSchedIDenrollMemApplSchedIDeditSchedIDenrollProcessSchedIDenrollProfSetSchedAssignEffDateenrollProfSetSchedAssignExpDateenrollProfSrcIdentIDsourceIdentifierTypesourceIdentifierValuedeleteInd2125306EPS_SYSTEM0A2176071(null)(null)DefaultSysMemEditSched(null)2023-07-019999-12-312155771ECUINT0ÿExample From Prod: MemGroupIDÿÿÿÿÿhttps://phi-splunk.optum.com/en-US/app/optum_cirrus/search?q=search%20sourcetype%3D%22core-cirrusecho%22%20b7e719b4-fd72-4c79-8d7f-bd64090d237f&display.page.search.mode=smart&dispatch.sample_ratio=1&earliest=-7d%40h&latest=now&sid=1695652766.1320741_25F3BFEB-A4BB-4779-82CB-8A2528B376E2ÿ",Ronin,22-09-2023,Closed,3-Medium,,,Customer Reported,6f0d6ef34719391879a6828a516d4398,,Incident,Aaron Gorman,,2023.PI47.3,Accepted,16-11-2023

The listByOverlappingDates should be using affilMemGroupId as a filter for non overriding values (affilMemGroupID would be 0). The original code had two separate list methods(listByOverlappingDatesForNonOverridingVO and listByOverlappingDatesForOverridingVO) and the code change combined the two methods into one but this filter was removed that existed in the original code: queryProperties.addQueryFilter(new QueryFilter(LegacyProviderFieldConstants.AFFILMEMGROUPID, 0));Upon Add/ Update, the dupe check should only check for duplicate records under memGroupContractProducer (where affilmemGroupID = 0) OR memgroupContractProducer Override record (where affilimemGroupID is NOT 0), NOT both sets of records together.Steps to reproduce:GIVEN: a Parent and Child memGroup in Cirrus, with Child inheriting Parent contract and memGroupContractAffil record is in Building or validation statusAND: memGroupContractAffilConfig.inheritMemGroupContractProducerInd = 0AND: Parent has a valid Contract with at least 1 Contract Option that is in active StatusAND: There is a valid memGroupContractProducer Override record for the same contractOptType as the Contract Option andÿ affilmemGroupID = Child memGroupIDAND: User navigates to the memGroupContractProducer screenÿAND creates a record with the same producerID, producerType, contractOptionType, memGroupID, writingAgentID, and overlapping timeline where affilmemGroupID = 0Actual Results: Producer add fails.

This is confusing to the user, as it's still displaying the name in the search panel but the search does not return corresponding results.ÿÿSolution: Upon clicking search, if the Member Group name is present on the UI but the Member Group ID is not, do not display the Member Group name.ÿSteps to Replicate:Navigate to Membership Error Queue UIEnter the required fields of Date + Category (current version) or Date + at least one of the following: Category, Member Group ID, Member IDIn US6001080, the required fields were updated to include a broader search - unsure if it will have been merged at the time of this workEnter the Member Group ID by using the magnifying glass to look up a value, and select the value in the popupNote the Member Group Name will display below the fieldManually delete the Member Group IDExpected Behavior: the Member Group Name is no longer displayed in the search panel and after clicking search, the search results returns data without the Member Group ID filter in placeActual Behavior: the Member Group Name remains on the screen under the Member Group ID field, and after clicking search, the search results return data without the Member Group filter considered (confusing to user)ÿSME:Jeff Wellan - ArchitectNancy McPherson - PODanielle LaRose - Dev Lead",QIB - Shazam,13-09-2023,Closed,3-Minor Problem,,,Internally Reported,,,,Kamal Tiwari,,2023.PI46.4,Accepted,28-09-2023

No changes are made to the events/ actionEvents.scheduledJob associated to the actionEvent is triggeredÿExpected Results: The actionEvents should systematically resolve to update to the new memGroupContractPlanOptionID (Primary Key) of the static PlanOptionID associated to the actionEvent. Then, the action event should process successfully.ÿActual Results: Only the first actionEvent associated to the Member Group Event is resolving correctly. The subsequent actionEvents still have the memGroupContractPlanOptionID ÿassociated to the old planOptionID and are thus not bring processed and remain in scheduled status.ÿAssumptions:Per existing logic, if a Plan Option ID was deleted in the older version of the contract option, then, the actionEvent associated to that Plan Option ID (static) will be updated to 'X' (canceled without execution) status when the job is processed.If a new Plan Option ID (static) was added to the Contract Option AFTER versioning, then it will remain unprocessed.

DE753274,Cirrus Member Group Contract Migration Table Displaying Incorrect Records post Scripting (CO Validation),"PO: Jamaal BuckleySA: Rishi KardamPR: DE753274: Member Group Contract Migration FixÿNote: This is only for the Contract Option validation. The data remediation part will be covered in DE783176ÿBackground:ÿData migration script from US5664588 chooses the earliest memGroupExternalID to derive the original source system type, which is incorrect on memGroups that have multiple externalIDs. So memGroupContractMigration table has incorrect records. We also need to see if there are groups where we missed creating the correct records because of the multiple external IDs. We also need to check to make sure that the heavyweight logic that adds records to the migration table is correct. For example, are there any problems with groups that have 2 memGroupExternalIDs?ÿOpening this INC to correct what seems to be an issue with how the Cirrus Member Group Contract Migration Table and UI is pulling records from previous Contracts.ÿCirrus MG ID: 1324392Issue Description:ÿThe Cirrus Member Group Contract Migration UI appears to have 4 records displayed in Prod --> two of which have an Original Source System Type of PRIME and Two of which have a Original Source System of PULSE.ÿ This particular group was setup and migrated with a PULSE Medical Contract, which was Cancelled.ÿ Additionally, the group had Dental and Vision on PRIME which recently migrated and created a new Contract and new Dental and Vision Contract Options.ÿThe table under this new Contract should only display the Dental and Vision Contract Option Types with an Original Source System Type = PRIME, the old PULSE details should not reflect.ÿQuestions that can most likely be answered by Kyle Bender:1. Can UHP have non-medical option types? There are currently non-medical option types in this table - is that data valid?2. Could we wipe all the data off this table and then re-run a completely new and improved script? (This would be done with a single script - there would be no """"down time"""" where the table is blank)ÿNew Logic for Data remediation script:ÿÿNote: Please refer to attachment for new logic.Warning Scenario:ÿ""""More than one original source system type found for memGroupID={1}, contractOptID={2}: {3}.

In each scenario below, instead of generating an error as expected, the logic is updating the city name to a different city. The city correction logic should not apply to these scenarios and it should be erroring instead.ÿÿThe scope of this feature is only to correct the city if it is unrecognized (does not exist in zipCode table). For example, if zipCode contains ?Saint Paul? but we pass St Paul, STP, or Siant Paul - we would correct it based off of the designated city in given zip code.ÿSince the cities in the ATDD below are valid cities in zipCode, we should not be changing them to another city. Expected behavior would be to error and not persist based off of the existing functionality. ÿÿScenario 3: Zip in State and City exists - RegressionGIVEN a city, state and zipcode combination in a Member AddressWHEN the combination of city and state is valid, and the zipcode is in that state but is incorrectTHEN validation will failExpected Outcome: an ERR00007 error will be generatedActual Outcome: city is updated to a different city, based off the zip codeMember IDs in Alpha:110007036101110007036102110007036104ÿScenario 6: Zip in State and City exists - RegressionGIVEN a city, state and zipcode combination in a Member AddressWHEN the combination of zip and state is valid and the city exists but is incorrectTHEN nothing will be updatedExpected Outcome: an ERR00007 error will be generatedActual Outcome: city is updated to a different city, based off the zip codeMember ID in Alpha:110007036104ÿNote: This was demonstrated to be working as expected in local environment, but not in alpha or production.

When setting termination for prior bill group the system automatically adds a bill group timeline for the current benefit year. This is an error and will prevent processing ability to timeline the prior bill group at member group level. If members remain active on prior bill group there is a system limitation that will not allow an expiration date to be installed. If you manually delete the erroneous bill group timeline from the member account, it deletes the entire record of the prior bill group and places an MBBG hold code on the member. This can be manually resolved by adding back the prior bill group manually, but it appears there is a system defect that is contributing to this error.

It appears there is a typo in the enrollTransCategory being used of 'EDI834510', when it should be ?EDI8345010?, which is causing the data to not populate correctly on the UI.ÿÿIn Alpha, we are currently saving in the Membership Error Queue transactional tables as:enrollCategory type of BTCH (Category drop down value of 'Electronic Batch File(EDI)') andÿenrollTransCategory of ?EDI834510? (Transaction Category dropdown value of ?EDI 834 5010 File').ÿÿAny query in the new Membership Error Queue yields no results with these Category and Transaction Category values, however, it returns a lot if transaction category of EDI834510 is not used. ÿÿThe referenceCode used for the referenceName of enrollTransCategory is ?EDI8345010?.ÿSolution:We will have problems changing what is saved given the USP dashboard uses the existing saved value.ÿ I (Jeff) don?t propose we change persisted values, but perhaps the REF Code value used in the service should change to align appropriately with ?EDI834510?, which is likely needed for error queue filtering to work.

DE732543,MBRMAT Hold throwing and locking out users.,"The ProblemÿThe Member in question was put on Member Match hold and the Member Match error was not generated.ÿÿJT 8/30/23 - Looks like there are multiple issues:Member did get a match with both an error record and hold. When the error record was resolved through the member-match screen, it created the member and closed the error but ran into a NPE which prevented the transaction from continuing and releasing the hold. This can happen when a dependent is sent alone on a request.Standalone dependents are not properly sending their input subscriber ID in the error queue payload, preventing a match resolution from being able to locate the subscriber on the second submission.Member got a match and hold, but error record was not initially created. Might be a SQL failure from checking splunk, need further investigation.PR https://github.com/uhc-tech-employer-individual/cirrus-apps_cirrus-core/pull/936/filesÿBackroundMember in question( 149182455 - YARBOROUGH, DENISE)Spouse and subscriber migrated from UHOPSThe spouse member match resulted in a potential match ÿin the dry run(stg)However in prod we failed on the processing ÿof the spouseWe set ÿthe MBRMAT hold, ÿbut we did not generate the member match errorThis has been attributed to a system issueÿMember Match should have matched the member as a three out of four match.ÿPotential Solution PathAnalyze Splink log and strackrace.

DE730631,Mismatch in Plan Year Month between CCV3 AST payload and Cirrus for Oxford small groups,"Duplicate of F916077 =ÿÿThere is a mismatch in the plan year month being sent on the AST payload and what was populated in Cirrus. The payload is sending September but Cirrus populated with August. This original mismatch occurred on 2022 renewals, and is now causing AST failures with the 2023 renewals. We started to see this with volume last month on the Oxford August renewal cycle and had 30 groups fail with ERR50210 - Input Plan Year Month does not align with Contract Option dates. For the September cycle, we had 25 groups fail.ÿThese groups were effective with dates other than 1st of the month - ex. 8/15/21, 8/21/21, 8/23/21, etc. and were installed with Plan Year Month of August. Renewal date set correctly for 9/1/2022. When the renewal payload was sent, it correctly sent over September, however, Cirrus failed to update the Plan Year Month to September and kept August. As a result, when the 2023 renewals are now running, the transaction sees a mismatch and fails the AST.ÿBelow is a list of the member group ids and transaction ids from 2022 so you can see that the payload correctly has '09' in the plan year month, but V1 of the 2022 renewal. Concern that this issue is perpetuating and requires a manual workaround to fix.

At the time of the enrollment , this contract option would have been the """"latest"""" contract option at the time, because the group' s ÿrenewal contract option was created on 12-12-2023 (contract ÿoption id of 95170736) .The system incorrectly looked for the ÿfor the plan option (PO100006) under the 08-01-2022 / 08-01-2022 contract option ÿ(56690835), ÿwas for one day of coverage and over laps with the contract option that we are supposed to be using.ÿSolution for the Issue : which class?

DE711670,Bill Group Detail Invoice Re-Derivation Utility: Search pop-up issue,"SA: SonaliPO: James BessePR: https://github.com/uhc-tech-employer-individual/cirrus-apps_cirrus-core/pull/426ÿDescription: Bill Group Detail Invoice Re-Derivation Utility, with Re-Derivation Option set as """"By Member and Member Benefit Plan"""" is not working when querying for the Member Benefit ID. Filtering by the Member Group ID and Benefit Bundle Option ID is not providing any results. We have been instructed to use this utility to reset a member's direct bill indicator, but we are unable to complete the reset due this utility issue.Dev notes from Kurt Schefers (submitter)Popup query is not returning results - also if entering value manually and perform submit action there is no status message and doesn't appear to be doing anything. I did not see anything in splunk logs indicating error.Looking at schedule job status - the job will kick off and complete if values entered are entered manually. Please add some additional logging statements, Status Message when performing submit action, and fix popup. It would be great if the scheduled job be refactored to correctly use SchedulerClient.ÿCreate a separate tech debt item to refactor the job, it will be out of scope for this defect.ÿSteps to reproduce:Navigate to the Bill Group Detail Invoice Re-Derivation UtilitySelect Re-Derivation Option = """"By Member and Member Benefit Plan""""Provide a Member Group ID that has members associated to itÿSelect the search pop-up against """"Member Benefit ID"""" fieldExpected Results: The search pop-up should show all ÿMember Benefit IDs associated to the Member Group ID (memberBenefitID where memberBenefit.memGroupID = input memGroupID) and where members have the holdCode """"MBBG"""" assigned to them.ÿActual Results: The search query does not show any results, even if a Member Group ID is provided within the Search pop-up filter.ÿAdditional Issues: After Dev and QE, additional issues were found with the pop-up, which are listed below:1. All the members associated to the Member Groups that have the MBBS hold should display on the Member Benefit Search Pop-up default results display. Currently, only some Members with the hold applied are showing up, this is since the query fetching the records is restricted to the first 11 results.ÿ2. Pagination is not working as expected on the pop-up. The default results list showed only two records even though there were 4 Member Benefit records with the MBBG hold applied to them. Additionally, the """"Next"""" hyperlink was highlighted indicating that there are more results on the next page but when clicked, showed no results. - This will be handled in a separate defect <add defect ID>ÿ3. The default search results are expected to display, when the search icon is clicked and the pop-up window is open, without having to click on the filter button. The default search results were not displaying correctly. This has already been fixed by Samakshi.ÿÿ4. When testing the Search pop-up, QE found that the utility will display Member Benefits that have the MBBG hold applied to them, even if the hold is not active. However, the Bill Group Invoice Hold column in the search results display does indicate if the hold is active or not. Is this the intended functionality of the pop-up OR are we to only display Member Benefit records that have active MBBG holds applied to them in the default list of results? - Pam confirmed that the results should only display active holds and this change will be made in this defect.

DE709202,(Converted to UserStory) Returning past policies in 271 from CIRRUS.,"US5779976Issue here is:When providers are submitting 270 with process dates, for instance(20211209-20221209), then 271 is returning only past policies inspite of having active coverages. It is because, for mentioned dates we are having 2 policies (plans) with same bundle optionId, i.e. one is expired and other one is renewed PFA Ss.Somehow CIRRUS business logic is picking only first record(expired) and returning in 271. We have raised tasks to CIRRUS and they involved Account Implementation team to merge this planOptions as its setup or configuration issue.They have come up saying that they can merge the records only when planOption and BundleOptionId are same, hence they as well told that this cannot done from their end.

The UAF form includes important information that underwriting uses when auditing the groups year over year. In Cirrus all large lob groups are required to have a Member Group Contract Plan Option Reporting Code listed bases on what the group has selected on the UAF. The current process is to just add the 100U Active option to all groups because the data is not available in OBM. This is causing incorrect reporting codes to be listed on many group impacting thousands of members that are not tied to the correct reporting code. Product entered by customer: Cirrus, OBMÿPer Stephanie RobinsonI was able to pull the data from 2022 for the volumes. This is the volume of membership that needed to be reviewed and edited due to the UCR not being loaded correctly in Cirrus.

There used to be a field in the UI that was required and was for the version of the Contract Option. This was removed, but the back end logic is still looking at the CO version at the time of the event creation vs the most recent.

Should be pulling from most recent active.ÿSteps to reproduce:A Member Group with a Contract and Contract Option being built manually with memGroupContractOpt is at version 1a Member group Event and the corresponding actionEvent is created. the Contract Option static ID is provided on the Member Group Event.The contract option is subsequently versioned, validated and activated (so it's currently version 2)The Member Group Action Event is processed.Actual Results: The action event is not processed since the memGroupContractOptID mentioned on the event is staleÿExpected Results: The process should take into consideration the highest active version of the Contract Option and process the action event.ÿSolution:ÿThis solution will need to be implemented for the below Member group Action Event Schedule Job listed:If the contractOptID specified on the memGroupEvent is not the highest version, then get the highest versionIf highest version is active, process Events using this version.

Update action event to store PK and static plan option IDIf not found, update the action event status to ?Cancel without execution (X)?If a new plan option was added to the highest version, then case install will need to create a new Member Group Event. Assumption is that these instructions are available in existing SOPs.Add logic to update the Member Group Event Status to ?Close? if all action events are either in (C) complete, (X) canceled with execution, (CWE) complete with errors statuses.Add logic to the below Member group events such that if a Member Group Event already exists with the same contractOptID (static) and a new one is created with the same information, then the OLD one will be ClosedÿNew BusinessOff-Cycle Plan ChangeStopLossRate GuaranteeNote that this logic already exists for AST, RST and Migration Member group events.

DE699262,Bill Group Not Persisted For Specific Timeline in Subsaffiliation Screens,"JT - 2 problems:1. Different contractOptTypes. When a vision BG ran through, it found an overlapping dentalÿBGÿand deletedÿit. Solution is to incorporate contractOptType into the BG logic properly2.ÿWhen there are multiple inbound (derived or supplied) bill groups that overlap an existing record, we are incorrectly trying to adjust and keep the existing record twice. We create a copy of the existing record that is valid for each of the inbound timelines separately, and try to persist both. When this runs through the bill group lookup logic, we have problems. Solution is to properly bump the incoming and existing full timelines together instead of treating each inbound record as a wholly separate entity.Fix is available on cirrus-core branchÿdefect/jthibode/DE699262_fix_existing_bg_persistance_for_multiple_contractOptTypesÿComment from Justin Thibodeau:ÿÿWithout digging to deep, it seems to be another instance of the problem seen by DE691033 / DE653287 / US4873609 but this time caused by multiple benefit timelines. Momina tested sending the 2 timelines of benefits in separate transactions as well and saw the same result (BG 1 derives but doesn?t properly persist).ÿMomina's Findings:System is not persisting the derived Bill group for a specific timeline in the members subs affiliations screen. System is logically deleting the existing derived Bill group when a new Bill group is getting added with next timelines.

The assumption is that because there are multiple threads that can retrieve records from Kafka, that thread A picked up a record, checked the memGroupInvoice table to see if the record existed (which it didn't at that time). ÿThread A was slow to process the record and respond to kafka so thread B pickec up the same record. ÿThread B did the same validation check in the memGroupInvoice table, but because thread A was still processing the record it passed the validatiob check and eventually both threads A and B inserted the same record into the memGroupInvoice (and child) tables. ÿWe either need to check the other threads that are processing to see if they have the same record in it or move the validation check to be immediately before inserting the record into the memGroupInvoice table.ÿSteps to Recreate:Post message to Kafka (the kafka instance that BRMS posts Premium Paid Through payloads to)Create a system processing delay so that multiple threads pick up the same recordThis occurs when Thread A picks up a record and doesn't respond back to Kafka in X seconds and Kafka marks the record as available again and another Thread picks up the same record.Expected Result:The record being processed will only be saved once in the memGroupInvoice (and child) table.The following error will be logged to the Member Group Error Queue with the transaction type: """"Member Group Invoice Premium Paid Thru"""":""""ERR883929 -ÿFor transaction: {0}, a duplicate invoice was found with the same identifying attributes: recordType: {1}, invoiceIdentifier: {2}, messageTimeStamp: {3}, and invoiceCreateDateTime: {4}.""""ÿActual Result:The record being processed is being saved multiple times in the memGroupInvoice (and child) table.No errors are being logged in the Member Group Error Queue.ÿTechnical Notes:For this defect, the validation check was kept at the beginning of the process when the thread first picks up the record and a second validation was added to the end of the process, just before the thread loads the record into the memGroupInvoice table. ÿWhen triggered, first validation check will be able to log the transaction ID in the error message. ÿIf the second (new validation check that was added in this defect) validation check is triggered it will no longer have the transaction ID in context so that field will be blank in the error message. ÿFor testing purposes, this is how we can definitively know that we have triggered the second validation check as opposed to the first.ÿAdditional Information:Three groups - impacted -ÿGroup 1466887ÿ1416560 & 1462302 (these will be fixed by prod support and documented in an INC).ÿWe added a duplicate check into the Premium Paid Through process (US4631495) last year. ÿThe logic was to error if we get multiple records with the same:InvoiceIdentifier in the payload =ÿÿ memGroupInvoice.extInvoiceID ANDInvoiceCreateDateTime in the payload =ÿmemGroupInvoice.InvoiceRunDate ANDmessageTimestamp in the payload =ÿmemGroupInvoice.messageTimestampÿANDrecordType in the payload =ÿmemGroupInvoice.extRecordTypeÿ",QIB - Shazam,05-04-2023,Closed,3-Medium,,Design/Code Change,Customer Reported,882dfec51b46a9d487dec8415b4bcb03,,Incident,Srishti Rustagi,validation / code issue,2023.PI45.3,Accepted,21-08-2023

If the user doesn?t touch the field, it will default to persist today?s date into the db. The UI will display todays date when retrieving the record, regardless of what is in the db. We currently use this field in member event service determining when retro events took place for benefit transactions to then notify claims team to reprocess those claims. Since that field is not a valid source of truth, we need to either fix it to become reliable, or we need to pick another field that could be used by the member event service rule evaluations. One option is to use the date value of changeDateTime. Another option is the transaction date time stamps on the meta data of the member event, however this already has its flaws today and doesn?t always send a value.ÿWe have 3 options to proceed here:Fix the lastEnrollmentTransactionDate to be a reliable source of truthValidate that the date saved must be todays dateMake this a read only field in the UI and ignored when sent in as something other than today via EDI (I?m not sure what side effects this could have though)Pick a different field as our source of truth for retro benefit rule evaluationschangeDateTime is one optionor the transaction date time stamp on the meta data of the member event (would need further code changes to rely on this field)Or any others ideas?Or both (if both, its probably separate defects)ÿI am not sure the best solution for this, and we?ll possibly need a combination of business and tech input.

Count in Echo for covLevelCode = SPC is 0In the Echo environment, the configuration of the standard Family Unit and Relationship Schedules also look to be configured correctly.ÿIn the Alpha environment, there's only 3 Member Groups associated to Member Group Contract Plan Bill Rate records configured to use a Billing Schedule that ties back to the Family Unit Schedule of 4T_SUB_DBL_TPL_FAM. None of these Member Group have any members in them; a query of the subsAffiliation table using these Member Group IDs yields zero members.See Member Groups: 1359247, 1360227, and 1367929.Next Steps:In Alpha, add a Member Group configured similar to 1359247, 1360227, or 1367929 but having current Member Group Contract Options and Plan Options, and ensure that the Plan Options tie back to a Bill Rate that maps to the Family Unit Schedule of 4T_SUB_DBL_TPL_FAMAdd a family to the Member Group consisting of 1 Subscriber, 1 Spouse, and 1 Dependent Child while ensuring that the Member Benefit they're enrolled into ties back to the correctly configured Plan Option (as described above)Confirm that the Coverage Level Code for this family unit is SPC after the installation is complete. ÿIf this is true, then this defect can be closed.ÿ- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -ÿ",Ronin,15-03-2023,Closed,3-Medium,Test,Not a Defect,Internally Reported,,,,Pam Heuer,,,Accepted,05-12-2023

DE688898,PCP Randomization on NexusACO members post 60-day grace period.,"Brief DescriptionThis set of defects - check with Dave H. that these are truly two separate issues -- revolves around two PCP-random assignment issues. This defect will work to explore the cause and solution for each issue, as well a determine whether they are related.ÿÿSummary: NexusACO Member receives correct warning that they have a grace period before they are assigned a PCP. An your later, the Members has been assigned a PCP.ÿIssue 1:ÿ When invoking randomization, the message below appears. It is as if the system does not recognize the 60-day grace period has passed nor does it provide any indication the randomization function is underway.The second issue deals with those working the error queue or attempting to resolve PCP assignment issues. The warning message mistakenly suggests the user has done something wrong.ÿÿÿAfter waiting an hour, the randomization was complete and assigned a PCP.ÿÿIdeally, the user should receive an acknowledgement message that randomization is in process, and it may take an hour to complete. The user should not receive the warning message above.ÿÿThere are a couple conditions that could cause random PCP assignment to not be delayedIf the Benefit effective date + the OAP were to equal to a date less than or equal to current date....the record would be written to MAE table and picked up in the next hourly runif the plan although NexusACO aligned did not have a OAP set....it would be treated like a """"regular"""" randomization requestbeneTierNetworkProvDetail of the member plan ÿhas to be set up with OAP and OAP Duration TypeÿÿSummary: Random PCP assignment is repeatedly unsuccessful.ÿIssue2:ÿ While analyzing a report which identifies NexusACO OA members without a PCP, Jason Merckling and I were trying to invoke PCP randomization to validate the steps an enrollment specialist would take to resolve missing PCP. Jason was unable to invoke randomization on any of the test members. Below is an example of a member where an attempt to randomization was made.ÿÿAttached to the INC is a list of members without a PCP assignment, post 60-day grace period.Note Column AR: In the sample of members checked (highlighted in yellow) two members had a PCP assignment, either through randomization or self-selected.",Heimdalls,14-03-2023,Closed,3-Minor Problem,,Converted,Customer Reported,cfe7dac61bade15423f1ca661a4bcb18,,Incident,Ben Miller,converted to a user story - US5058552,2023.PI46.1,Accepted,29-08-2023

The Transaction table shows that SAMx submitted duplicate memGroupLoad payloads within a second of each other.2.

There is a validation preventing duplicate records on the UI, but it seems like this is not extended to API installs4. The Contract Option is validating successfully but upon activation, it is running into this application error.

Contract option validation applies a check to ensure the stop loss and entity reserve periods are in alignment for a given contract option period. However, it appears this check is validating for all historical SL and ER periods, instead of the periods that fall within the contract option timeline.As can be seen below, the SL and ER periods are aligned for the new contract option timeline. However, it appears the validation is check SL and ER periods that fall outside the range of the contract option. The check should only compare the SL and ER periods that fall within the CO timeline.If there is a partial overlap with the Stoploss and Entity Reserve timelines with the Contract Option timeline, then they will be considered when adding/ updating the Stoploss and Entity Reserve assignment for the Plan Option.The validation will check to ensure that the stoploss and ER timelines match.ÿEnvironment: MasterÿMaster Example: Member Group: 1422655Contract option period 2/1/2023 - 1/31/2024Plan Options PO100003 and PO100004Stoploss policyÿperiod 2/1/2023 - 1/31/2024Entity Reserve periodÿ2/1/2023 - 1/31/2024ÿSteps to reproduce:1.

Unfortunately, there are lot of transactions being missed and not sent to COM360 for document generation. COM360 is receiving a lot of emails from the customers about their missing benefit documents. Because of this gap in Cirrus, COM360 is not able to meet the compliance requirements to fulfill SBC's and COC's as per the federal guidelines.For some groups events has been created but not action event created for the group. For some groups, even the group event has not been created.Attached the snapshots to explain the above issue. and the groups that missed the automatic triggering event from Cirrus.https://uhgazure.sharepoint.com/sites/SBI/PRIMEOperations/USP%20Fulfillment%20Reporting%20BCM/Forms/AllItems.aspxIn the above link, the daily report has the transactions being missed and not sent to COM360 for document generation.ÿSA Notes after analyzingÿattached spreadsheet.The defect has about 103 Member Groups with different gaps or issues(in attached spreadsheet). I did some spot checking on some of these groups and found:Event was created but Contract was subsequently cancelled.Event was created but no actionEvent was createdEvent was created but the Contract Option was versioned or plan option was deleted ? this was also what Gomathi found in her analysis of the spreadsheet.Also, we did a recent spike (this one I think, US5349499) that closed out action events where the plan option was deleted after actionEvent creation. I think this is the reason some of the Action Events are in ?Closed without Execution? status. It also looks like some of them were manually closed out by other users.Gomathi pointed out that these PGAs are often raised for multiple groups/ plan options where it?s hard to pin down the scope as there are many issues across the groups submitted in the ticket (See related email attached titled ?FW:Defect Question?).ÿ",QIB - Rogue,18-01-2023,Closed,3-Medium,Production,Design/Code Change,Customer Reported,ba36f3141b2cad1867af32af034bcbff,,Incident,Logan Fabyanske,,2023.PI44.3,Accepted,08-05-2023

Needs to be on 1.319 AND DevelopDL April 3: Needs to PR onto 1.318 for April 5 deployment. Also needs to be on Develop for Alpha testing.ÿDescription:Logic which was implemented in US6694169 to change how we're creating billing scheduled for Producer records which have a compensation type of Service Fee. ÿThe Billing Schedule is being created using the sysBillingDefaultValue information which has the given CarrierID, situsState, revenue arrangement, contract option type, date range, and billing calc method. ÿBasics isn't always sending the situs state in the AOR feed which is causing failures. ÿÿTo fix this issue, when the AOR feed doesn't contain the situs state we will be deriving situs state from the Contract Option with the same Contract Option Type (in the AOR feed for the producer) and which overlaps the Producer's effective date. ÿIf no contract options overlap the producer's effective date, use the contract option which is closest to the producer effective date.ÿSteps to reproduce:Create Member Group with Contract and active Contract Options in Cirrus.Post Basics payload/AOR Feed to kafka instance that Producer updates are posted topayload should have a compensation Type = 'Service Fee' AND does not have a situs state in the payloadExpected Result:MemGroupContractProducer records are successfully created using the information in the Basics payload and the identified Contract Option's situs state.ÿActual Result:MemGroupContractProducer records are not created and ERR891051 is logged in the Member Group Error Queue.ÿÿAdditional Information:Please confirm whether the producer assignment kafka service is up and running on your end in Alpha.

The actual sfa row with producer details AND a Direct Crid with 999999 as Producer External ID and Writing Agent External ID.ÿÿWhat?s happening is the Direct Crid is being populated in the Producer tab but not the actual SFA producer record.

DE861094,Data Remediation | Populate Missing Coc Year on Plan Options,"PO: Tajoura (TJ) DavisSA: Sonali PereiraPR: https://github.com/uhc-tech-employer-individual/cirrus-apps_cirrus-core/pull/2085ÿÿJob Info:ÿJOBID: MGCPOCOC - all tenant jobLogger Result message format: {number of plan opt ids updated} Plan Options Updated, {number of plan opt ids failed} Plan Options Failed To Update MemGroupContractPlanOptIDs: {failed plan opt ids}ÿIssue Description:Users were previously unable to manually validate groups in Cirrus via the UI as they were getting a CoC error on the pop-up UI. Users are now able to pick the CoC Year manually but the volume of impacted groups is high enough for data remediation to be needed.ÿBusiness Requirements:ÿAs the Cirrus system, I need to be able to assign the CoC year from the benefit plan via a data remediation one-time job for groups where the value is required (Oxford FI, UHOPS LF, UHC FI) in the CoC year field of the plan option in to make the value available for the selection of benefits and fulfillment documents downstream.Once the data remediation is run, generate a report of all the plan options where CoC year should have been populated but was not.The job should be able to be run again as needed, potentially every year. This is because Oxford groups are manually built in Cirrus and CoC year is the last thing added to a plan option. The CoC year selected needs to be most recent/relevant at the time that the group is renewed and this is not known by Case Install at the time of renewal since groups renew up to 3 months in advance.Once the job is created, TJ will create a business process to have the Renewal Team submit an incident ticket when the job needs to be run in future.Data Remediation Logic (to be performed in all environments):Get memGroupContractPlanOption records where CoC year is NOT populated (includes logically deleted records).Of those identified, get plan options tied to a Medical contract option.Check if the group/plan option should be excluded, skip populating CoC year for excluded groups. Below are the criteria for excluded groups:TUFTS - a TUFTS plan option will have memGroupContractPlanOption.sellingCarrierID IN (1190006, 1221264, 1221265, 1221365)Oxford ASO - The base benefit plan associated to the plan option will have revenueArrangement = 04 (ASO) or 06 (ASO with Stoploss). To get the benefitPlan associated to the memGroupContractPlanOption, use memGroupContractPlanOption.<benefitBundleID>.<benefitBundleOptionID>.<benefitPlanID highest active version>.revenueArrangement.Surest - The base benefit plan associated to the plan option will have externalPlanInd = 1 (TRUE) for a Surest plan.If a plan option was NOT part of excluded groups, get the base benefit plan associated to the plan option, then get the CoC year from the record on beneCOCYear where beneCOCYear.benefitPlanVersionID = benefitPlan.benefitPlanVersionID and beneCOCYear timeline overlaps the memgroupContractOption.effectiveDate.ÿderive ÿplan yearplan year = renewal date - 1 year, if contract opt length <= 12 monthsplan year = Contract opt eff date, if contract opt length > 12 monthsThe derived plan year should be between COC effective and Expiration date, then update the plan option COC yearÿAssumptions:Groups that do not require this update (Surest ASO/FI/LF, Tufts, Oxford ASO) will be skipped when the job is run.ÿÿMGIDINC1618035INC36045591584374INC360448001612031INC360462261510442INC360300611270313ÿ1644283INC360307391417718INC360290571612031INC360462261530113INC360447341584374INC360448001646688INC360097041494096INC360491451510076ÿ1510459ÿ1517958ÿ1510143ÿ1395403ÿ1596550ÿ1620377ÿ1430127ÿÿ",QIB - Rogue,20-03-2024,Open,2-Major Problem,,,Customer Reported,,,,Russell Hammond,inconsistent timing in CoC Year being available on the benefit plan and the group renewal occurring,2024.PI49.2,In-Progress,

However, it was resulting in an override of the subsAffiliationExternalID and concatenation of subsAffilExtIDContOptType records when the existing and incoming externalIDs were different but the same type.DE847527 updated this so that the existing subsAffiliationExternalID / subsAffilExtIDContOptType would be logically deleted, and a new record created for the new subsAffiliationExternalID / subsAffilExtIDContOptType combo. However, this is still not fully correct.Instead, we should be creating multiple line items for each subsAffiliationExternalID / subsAffilExtIDContOptType combo. This is available via UI actions but is not available during systematic processing.ÿRequirements:Enhance the systematic processing logic of subsAffiliationExternalID / subsAffilExtIDContOptType to allow for multiple externalIDs to exist for the same externalIDType, so long as the contractOptTypes are distinct.ÿSteps to reproduce:Migration File is successfully processed with Prime Member ID A and a contract option of MedicalA second migration file comes for the SAME member and subsAffiliation but a new Prime Member ID B and contract option of DentalExpected:Existing subsAffiliationExternalID / subsAffilExtIDContOptType records for Prime Member ID A / Medical are untouched (and not deleted)New subsAffiliationExternalID / subsAffilExtIDContOptType records are created in parallel for the new Prime Member ID B / DentalActual (post DE847527 implementation):Existing subsAffiliationExternalID / subsAffilExtIDContOptType records for Prime Member ID A / Medical are logically deletedNew subsAffiliationExternalID / subsAffilExtIDContOptType records are created in parallel for the new Prime Member ID B / DentalÿSMEs:Danielle LaRoseKen FarmerJeff Wellan",QIB - Shazam,26-02-2024,Closed,2-Major Problem,,Design/Code Change,Internally Reported,,,,Keith Rieck,US6547071,2024.PI48.4,Accepted,14-03-2024

In the case of the other 2 members (43732484, 125952190), they should have been triggered once the PCP was added based off the stateMandatePcPReq Rule Set. I found a few issues with our call to the rule service engine located in the MemberIDCardRuleImpl. We are only sending memGroupConractOpt.situsState and memberAddress.state when making the query which will never return a true result; all AND fields below are needed.The rule fields seem to be case sensitive, and our situsState constant being used is """"SITUSSTATE"""" so again it will never return a true result unless case correct.

This is in accordance with Scenario 7 in US5727238. According to the notes: ÿ""""If the city name is a valid city name in Cirrus, and it's entered with a zip code that's also valid but does not align [ie.

St Louis, MO and St Paul, MN do not exist today in the zipcode table in the database, therefore, the code should take this into consideration and update the city name based off of the city/state/zip logic.

Creating this defect after discussion with Dave to find the root cause from IT perspective and resolve this issue permanently.ÿSome of the reported incidents are - INC34720330, INC34720465, INC34717943, INC34718172, INC34718235 & INC 34718068.ÿExample memberIDs - 164037220, 164422495, 164179074, 164179080, 164361825, 164422481, 164422486, 164067826, 164341354, 164057807, 164078060, 164179480, 164503714, 164513911, 163954252.Please note that I have released the hold from backend for these members as of now. There are more incidents and members that I am working on to release the hold.ÿOpened PRB1420810 ÿfor this.ÿÿÿI was able to get the python script to pull all impacted members that have MBRMAT hold but are not present in enrlmnt error queue . I see 600+ of such members as of today and this is after I already cleared many from yesterday. ÿThe count could be more since I am pulling this from Snowflake database (not directly from Cirrus)ÿExample members attachedÿÿ",Heimdalls,06-12-2023,Submitted,2-Major Problem,Production,,Internally Reported,PRB1420810,,,Dave Haas,,,Refining,

DE809351,Fix flaky MemberBenefitInsuringRuleServiceSpec which may be system-date-sensitive to failure,"The following test was found failing in Develop as of 11/29/23 and so was ignored. This needs attention particularly in the event that the root cause may be the system date and revealing a use case indicative of a real production defect. It of course may also just be the test itself that is flawed. Certainly any test that fails based on the date/time that it is run has a weakness to improve upon regardless.ÿÿThis test was failed on 11/29/2023, we set birthdate 92 days away (2/29/2024) minus 26 years, should be 02/29/1998, but 1998 only have 28 days in Feb. The birthday actually was set to 02/28/1998, after 26 years, the birth day 02/28/2024 is exactly 91 days away from today, so the OAD maxed out, changed to 99 days to make sure not max out.

DE806256,PROD | Contract Termination Incorrectly Deleting MemGroupContractMigration,"SA: Anne Roeber / Rishi KardamPO: Nancy McphersonPR: DE806256: MemGroupContractMigration Termination Logic FixÿIssue Description:When a member group contract is terminated, its existing contract migration records are always being logically deleted. This should only occur when the termination date is before the migration contract option effective date but this is not currently happening, resulting in incorrectly logically deleted contract migration records.During the contract termination process, contract option validation occurs, which systematically creates a new contract migration record. Then, when the contract is reinstated, the original logically deleted contract migration records are reinstated, resulting in duplicate records.ÿSteps to recreate:Create a member group contract with active contract options.A contract migration record is systematically added upon contract option validation (implemented in US5664708).Terminate the contract where the termination date is after the migration contract option effective date.The existing contract migration record is systematically logically deleted.Reinstate the contract.Expected Result:Migration contract record should not be logically deleted upon termination.No duplicate contract migration records exist upon reinstatement.ÿActual Result:Migration contract record is logically deleted upon termination.Duplicate contract migration records exist.ÿAdditional Information:TCR support for memGroupContractMigration was originally implemented in US5612769.Duplicate records existing on memGroupContractMigration will causes duplicates on extracts.ÿRequirements:Update the contract and contract option termination process to correctly handle the termination of memGroupContractMigration records.Only terminate (logically delete) memGroupContractMigration records when termination date is before the migContractOptEffDate.Run data remediation in all environments to delete duplicate contract migration records from the memGroupContractMigration table (via V99* file).Out of Scope:Member Group Contract Affiliation Termination, Contract Option Cancellation / Reinstatement (future enhancement)A script to handle incorrectly logically deleted records will be handled through support via INC35657714.ÿ",QIB - Rogue,21-11-2023,Open,2-Major Problem,Production,Design/Code Change,Internally Reported,,INC35657714,,Logan Fabyanske,US5612769,2024.PI48.3,Accepted,16-02-2024

Trying to load 17 Days.Surest group requesting a 17 custom rehire waiting period. But Cirrus is generating an error saying 17 days is invalid. An INC was submitted and the IT resource said the only values allowed are 30, 45, 60, 90 - the implementation of a day restriction should not have been implemented for custom insuring rules.

Membership is not being moved to the new location, in this case population, and is also not generating an error for why the membership is not moving. Example group below was sent to move 21 subscribers to different population placements based on benefits totaling 45 population updates. In Cirrus the initial match count shows 45 to match the sheet but only 7 are attempted and only 6 moved with 1 fail. In the error queue the one member failing has an error """"Member move failed. Please contact your system administrator."""" We have just over 4100 members that failed to move using the member move/matrix file for the 1/1 cycle and most look like they are due to this same issue when I look at the group. Please see attached matrix file as a sample of the file sent to move membership along with Cirrus Screenshots and Error Screenshots Product entered by customer: CirrusÿRoot problem is 2-fold:The member is failing to get a coverage population, when this happens we apply a COVPOP hold. This hold is attempting to add using effective date as todays date, but the member's affiliation is future dated. This logic needs to be updated to ensure the COVPOP hold is within the SA timeline, or bypass validation.When the COVPOP hold fails, we attempt to put the member on an MMUE hold. This includes a low level check in the abstract hold logic for no overlapping holds, which is incorrectly identifying a previously closed MMUE hold since it is technically overlapping for 1 day (the first day of the SA timeline). If member move fails to add a MMUE hold, this is treated as a catastrophic failure and the rest of the move is aborted and not attempted. The overlap check needs to be updated to exclude records where releasedInd is true to ensure the new hold can be added appropriately.",Ronin,24-10-2023,Closed,3-Minor Problem,,,Customer Reported,32489b06874efd5083622178dabb35cf,,Incident,Aaron Gorman,,2023.PI47.3,Accepted,09-11-2023

So memGroupContractMigration table has incorrect records. We also need to see if there are groups where we missed creating the correct records because of the multiple external IDs. We also need to check to make sure that the heavyweight logic that adds records to the migration table is correct. For example, are there any problems with groups that have 2 memGroupExternalIDs?ÿOpening this INC to correct what seems to be an issue with how the Cirrus Member Group Contract Migration Table and UI is pulling records from previous Contracts.ÿCirrus MG ID: 1324392Issue Description:ÿThe Cirrus Member Group Contract Migration UI appears to have 4 records displayed in Prod --> two of which have an Original Source System Type of PRIME and Two of which have a Original Source System of PULSE.ÿ This particular group was setup and migrated with a PULSE Medical Contract, which was Cancelled.ÿ Additionally, the group had Dental and Vision on PRIME which recently migrated and created a new Contract and new Dental and Vision Contract Options.ÿThe table under this new Contract should only display the Dental and Vision Contract Option Types with an Original Source System Type = PRIME, the old PULSE details should not reflect.ÿQuestions that can most likely be answered by Kyle Bender:1.

When you look up the same error in the old queue though, memberEnrollmentErrorQueue.queueItemStatus remains = 1 while the memberEnrollmentErrorQueueDtl.queueItemDetailStatus = 5. There seems to be a disconnect in the old queue statuses - see below. Jeff has confirmed that in prod the Queue Item Status should be set to 'Closed' when Queue Detail Status = Bulk Closed. Kamal and I tested the bulk close 'Close' and 'Close All' actions directly within the old queue (Member Enrollment Error Queue) and those are working as expected, setting the Queue Item Status to 'Closed'.

Attribute Derivation Schedule ID field required even though the group does not have an Enrollment Profile Set ID, custom attributes, or memGroup External IDs. Logic is checking SysMemGroupSetting for EnrollProfileSet and it is present in Production and logic then requires Attribute Derivation ScheduleID to be required. ÿIn addition, when a group has some members that need derivation and others that do not, the schedule shouldn't be required.ÿThe change made from this defect is to ease the validation and not make the Attribute Derivation Schedule required when available.ÿNotes:Its combination of code changes and current settings ? shown below is the Enroll profile set that is being picked up .ÿCode changes done in DE714346 removes the limitation on mg ext ID and looks at EPS at system level ? so between these code changes and sysMemGroupSettings/enroll profile set ÿits causing the breaking change.ÿDescription from defect:?The new Derivation Lookup includes a limitation that only looks at External ID's for a MG. ÿThis limitation needs to be removed and hot fixed as soon as possible?ÿFrom commit message: ?Changes are made to find all Attribute Derivation schedules that a member group can use.ÿ It will grab all Derivation Schedules from and EPS assigned at the MemGroupSettings level as well as all System Level Derivation schedules where the Group satisfies the source identifiers.?ÿNow with the code changes when there is no memGroup External IDs and no memGroupSettings for EPS it does a lookup in enrollProfSetView using a default source Identifier value of UINT and the and the enroll profile set ID defined at systemMemGroupSettings and returns a record. As a result of returning this value it sets the display logic on member guided entry to require attribute derivation schedule IDÿRecord returned from enrollProfSetView:enrollProfSetVersionIDenrollProfSetIDlockedMemGroupIDsetStatusenrollProfSetSchedAssignIDenrollAttribDerivSchedIDenrollMemApplSchedIDeditSchedIDenrollProcessSchedIDenrollProfSetSchedAssignEffDateenrollProfSetSchedAssignExpDateenrollProfSrcIdentIDsourceIdentifierTypesourceIdentifierValuedeleteInd2125306EPS_SYSTEM0A2176071(null)(null)DefaultSysMemEditSched(null)2023-07-019999-12-312155771ECUINT0ÿExample From Prod: MemGroupIDÿÿÿÿÿhttps://phi-splunk.optum.com/en-US/app/optum_cirrus/search?q=search%20sourcetype%3D%22core-cirrusecho%22%20b7e719b4-fd72-4c79-8d7f-bd64090d237f&display.page.search.mode=smart&dispatch.sample_ratio=1&earliest=-7d%40h&latest=now&sid=1695652766.1320741_25F3BFEB-A4BB-4779-82CB-8A2528B376E2ÿ",Ronin,22-09-2023,Closed,3-Medium,,,Customer Reported,6f0d6ef34719391879a6828a516d4398,,Incident,Aaron Gorman,,2023.PI47.3,Accepted,16-11-2023

The listByOverlappingDates should be using affilMemGroupId as a filter for non overriding values (affilMemGroupID would be 0). The original code had two separate list methods(listByOverlappingDatesForNonOverridingVO and listByOverlappingDatesForOverridingVO) and the code change combined the two methods into one but this filter was removed that existed in the original code: queryProperties.addQueryFilter(new QueryFilter(LegacyProviderFieldConstants.AFFILMEMGROUPID, 0));Upon Add/ Update, the dupe check should only check for duplicate records under memGroupContractProducer (where affilmemGroupID = 0) OR memgroupContractProducer Override record (where affilimemGroupID is NOT 0), NOT both sets of records together.Steps to reproduce:GIVEN: a Parent and Child memGroup in Cirrus, with Child inheriting Parent contract and memGroupContractAffil record is in Building or validation statusAND: memGroupContractAffilConfig.inheritMemGroupContractProducerInd = 0AND: Parent has a valid Contract with at least 1 Contract Option that is in active StatusAND: There is a valid memGroupContractProducer Override record for the same contractOptType as the Contract Option andÿ affilmemGroupID = Child memGroupIDAND: User navigates to the memGroupContractProducer screenÿAND creates a record with the same producerID, producerType, contractOptionType, memGroupID, writingAgentID, and overlapping timeline where affilmemGroupID = 0Actual Results: Producer add fails.

This is confusing to the user, as it's still displaying the name in the search panel but the search does not return corresponding results.ÿÿSolution: Upon clicking search, if the Member Group name is present on the UI but the Member Group ID is not, do not display the Member Group name.ÿSteps to Replicate:Navigate to Membership Error Queue UIEnter the required fields of Date + Category (current version) or Date + at least one of the following: Category, Member Group ID, Member IDIn US6001080, the required fields were updated to include a broader search - unsure if it will have been merged at the time of this workEnter the Member Group ID by using the magnifying glass to look up a value, and select the value in the popupNote the Member Group Name will display below the fieldManually delete the Member Group IDExpected Behavior: the Member Group Name is no longer displayed in the search panel and after clicking search, the search results returns data without the Member Group ID filter in placeActual Behavior: the Member Group Name remains on the screen under the Member Group ID field, and after clicking search, the search results return data without the Member Group filter considered (confusing to user)ÿSME:Jeff Wellan - ArchitectNancy McPherson - PODanielle LaRose - Dev Lead",QIB - Shazam,13-09-2023,Closed,3-Minor Problem,,,Internally Reported,,,,Kamal Tiwari,,2023.PI46.4,Accepted,28-09-2023

No changes are made to the events/ actionEvents.scheduledJob associated to the actionEvent is triggeredÿExpected Results: The actionEvents should systematically resolve to update to the new memGroupContractPlanOptionID (Primary Key) of the static PlanOptionID associated to the actionEvent. Then, the action event should process successfully.ÿActual Results: Only the first actionEvent associated to the Member Group Event is resolving correctly. The subsequent actionEvents still have the memGroupContractPlanOptionID ÿassociated to the old planOptionID and are thus not bring processed and remain in scheduled status.ÿAssumptions:Per existing logic, if a Plan Option ID was deleted in the older version of the contract option, then, the actionEvent associated to that Plan Option ID (static) will be updated to 'X' (canceled without execution) status when the job is processed.If a new Plan Option ID (static) was added to the Contract Option AFTER versioning, then it will remain unprocessed.

DE753274,Cirrus Member Group Contract Migration Table Displaying Incorrect Records post Scripting (CO Validation),"PO: Jamaal BuckleySA: Rishi KardamPR: DE753274: Member Group Contract Migration FixÿNote: This is only for the Contract Option validation. The data remediation part will be covered in DE783176ÿBackground:ÿData migration script from US5664588 chooses the earliest memGroupExternalID to derive the original source system type, which is incorrect on memGroups that have multiple externalIDs. So memGroupContractMigration table has incorrect records. We also need to see if there are groups where we missed creating the correct records because of the multiple external IDs. We also need to check to make sure that the heavyweight logic that adds records to the migration table is correct. For example, are there any problems with groups that have 2 memGroupExternalIDs?ÿOpening this INC to correct what seems to be an issue with how the Cirrus Member Group Contract Migration Table and UI is pulling records from previous Contracts.ÿCirrus MG ID: 1324392Issue Description:ÿThe Cirrus Member Group Contract Migration UI appears to have 4 records displayed in Prod --> two of which have an Original Source System Type of PRIME and Two of which have a Original Source System of PULSE.ÿ This particular group was setup and migrated with a PULSE Medical Contract, which was Cancelled.ÿ Additionally, the group had Dental and Vision on PRIME which recently migrated and created a new Contract and new Dental and Vision Contract Options.ÿThe table under this new Contract should only display the Dental and Vision Contract Option Types with an Original Source System Type = PRIME, the old PULSE details should not reflect.ÿQuestions that can most likely be answered by Kyle Bender:1. Can UHP have non-medical option types? There are currently non-medical option types in this table - is that data valid?2. Could we wipe all the data off this table and then re-run a completely new and improved script? (This would be done with a single script - there would be no """"down time"""" where the table is blank)ÿNew Logic for Data remediation script:ÿÿNote: Please refer to attachment for new logic.Warning Scenario:ÿ""""More than one original source system type found for memGroupID={1}, contractOptID={2}: {3}.

In each scenario below, instead of generating an error as expected, the logic is updating the city name to a different city. The city correction logic should not apply to these scenarios and it should be erroring instead.ÿÿThe scope of this feature is only to correct the city if it is unrecognized (does not exist in zipCode table). For example, if zipCode contains ?Saint Paul? but we pass St Paul, STP, or Siant Paul - we would correct it based off of the designated city in given zip code.ÿSince the cities in the ATDD below are valid cities in zipCode, we should not be changing them to another city. Expected behavior would be to error and not persist based off of the existing functionality. ÿÿScenario 3: Zip in State and City exists - RegressionGIVEN a city, state and zipcode combination in a Member AddressWHEN the combination of city and state is valid, and the zipcode is in that state but is incorrectTHEN validation will failExpected Outcome: an ERR00007 error will be generatedActual Outcome: city is updated to a different city, based off the zip codeMember IDs in Alpha:110007036101110007036102110007036104ÿScenario 6: Zip in State and City exists - RegressionGIVEN a city, state and zipcode combination in a Member AddressWHEN the combination of zip and state is valid and the city exists but is incorrectTHEN nothing will be updatedExpected Outcome: an ERR00007 error will be generatedActual Outcome: city is updated to a different city, based off the zip codeMember ID in Alpha:110007036104ÿNote: This was demonstrated to be working as expected in local environment, but not in alpha or production.

When setting termination for prior bill group the system automatically adds a bill group timeline for the current benefit year. This is an error and will prevent processing ability to timeline the prior bill group at member group level. If members remain active on prior bill group there is a system limitation that will not allow an expiration date to be installed. If you manually delete the erroneous bill group timeline from the member account, it deletes the entire record of the prior bill group and places an MBBG hold code on the member. This can be manually resolved by adding back the prior bill group manually, but it appears there is a system defect that is contributing to this error.

It appears there is a typo in the enrollTransCategory being used of 'EDI834510', when it should be ?EDI8345010?, which is causing the data to not populate correctly on the UI.ÿÿIn Alpha, we are currently saving in the Membership Error Queue transactional tables as:enrollCategory type of BTCH (Category drop down value of 'Electronic Batch File(EDI)') andÿenrollTransCategory of ?EDI834510? (Transaction Category dropdown value of ?EDI 834 5010 File').ÿÿAny query in the new Membership Error Queue yields no results with these Category and Transaction Category values, however, it returns a lot if transaction category of EDI834510 is not used. ÿÿThe referenceCode used for the referenceName of enrollTransCategory is ?EDI8345010?.ÿSolution:We will have problems changing what is saved given the USP dashboard uses the existing saved value.ÿ I (Jeff) don?t propose we change persisted values, but perhaps the REF Code value used in the service should change to align appropriately with ?EDI834510?, which is likely needed for error queue filtering to work.

DE732543,MBRMAT Hold throwing and locking out users.,"The ProblemÿThe Member in question was put on Member Match hold and the Member Match error was not generated.ÿÿJT 8/30/23 - Looks like there are multiple issues:Member did get a match with both an error record and hold. When the error record was resolved through the member-match screen, it created the member and closed the error but ran into a NPE which prevented the transaction from continuing and releasing the hold. This can happen when a dependent is sent alone on a request.Standalone dependents are not properly sending their input subscriber ID in the error queue payload, preventing a match resolution from being able to locate the subscriber on the second submission.Member got a match and hold, but error record was not initially created. Might be a SQL failure from checking splunk, need further investigation.PR https://github.com/uhc-tech-employer-individual/cirrus-apps_cirrus-core/pull/936/filesÿBackroundMember in question( 149182455 - YARBOROUGH, DENISE)Spouse and subscriber migrated from UHOPSThe spouse member match resulted in a potential match ÿin the dry run(stg)However in prod we failed on the processing ÿof the spouseWe set ÿthe MBRMAT hold, ÿbut we did not generate the member match errorThis has been attributed to a system issueÿMember Match should have matched the member as a three out of four match.ÿPotential Solution PathAnalyze Splink log and strackrace.

DE730631,Mismatch in Plan Year Month between CCV3 AST payload and Cirrus for Oxford small groups,"Duplicate of F916077 =ÿÿThere is a mismatch in the plan year month being sent on the AST payload and what was populated in Cirrus. The payload is sending September but Cirrus populated with August. This original mismatch occurred on 2022 renewals, and is now causing AST failures with the 2023 renewals. We started to see this with volume last month on the Oxford August renewal cycle and had 30 groups fail with ERR50210 - Input Plan Year Month does not align with Contract Option dates. For the September cycle, we had 25 groups fail.ÿThese groups were effective with dates other than 1st of the month - ex. 8/15/21, 8/21/21, 8/23/21, etc. and were installed with Plan Year Month of August. Renewal date set correctly for 9/1/2022. When the renewal payload was sent, it correctly sent over September, however, Cirrus failed to update the Plan Year Month to September and kept August. As a result, when the 2023 renewals are now running, the transaction sees a mismatch and fails the AST.ÿBelow is a list of the member group ids and transaction ids from 2022 so you can see that the payload correctly has '09' in the plan year month, but V1 of the 2022 renewal. Concern that this issue is perpetuating and requires a manual workaround to fix.

At the time of the enrollment , this contract option would have been the """"latest"""" contract option at the time, because the group' s ÿrenewal contract option was created on 12-12-2023 (contract ÿoption id of 95170736) .The system incorrectly looked for the ÿfor the plan option (PO100006) under the 08-01-2022 / 08-01-2022 contract option ÿ(56690835), ÿwas for one day of coverage and over laps with the contract option that we are supposed to be using.ÿSolution for the Issue : which class?

DE711670,Bill Group Detail Invoice Re-Derivation Utility: Search pop-up issue,"SA: SonaliPO: James BessePR: https://github.com/uhc-tech-employer-individual/cirrus-apps_cirrus-core/pull/426ÿDescription: Bill Group Detail Invoice Re-Derivation Utility, with Re-Derivation Option set as """"By Member and Member Benefit Plan"""" is not working when querying for the Member Benefit ID. Filtering by the Member Group ID and Benefit Bundle Option ID is not providing any results. We have been instructed to use this utility to reset a member's direct bill indicator, but we are unable to complete the reset due this utility issue.Dev notes from Kurt Schefers (submitter)Popup query is not returning results - also if entering value manually and perform submit action there is no status message and doesn't appear to be doing anything. I did not see anything in splunk logs indicating error.Looking at schedule job status - the job will kick off and complete if values entered are entered manually. Please add some additional logging statements, Status Message when performing submit action, and fix popup. It would be great if the scheduled job be refactored to correctly use SchedulerClient.ÿCreate a separate tech debt item to refactor the job, it will be out of scope for this defect.ÿSteps to reproduce:Navigate to the Bill Group Detail Invoice Re-Derivation UtilitySelect Re-Derivation Option = """"By Member and Member Benefit Plan""""Provide a Member Group ID that has members associated to itÿSelect the search pop-up against """"Member Benefit ID"""" fieldExpected Results: The search pop-up should show all ÿMember Benefit IDs associated to the Member Group ID (memberBenefitID where memberBenefit.memGroupID = input memGroupID) and where members have the holdCode """"MBBG"""" assigned to them.ÿActual Results: The search query does not show any results, even if a Member Group ID is provided within the Search pop-up filter.ÿAdditional Issues: After Dev and QE, additional issues were found with the pop-up, which are listed below:1. All the members associated to the Member Groups that have the MBBS hold should display on the Member Benefit Search Pop-up default results display. Currently, only some Members with the hold applied are showing up, this is since the query fetching the records is restricted to the first 11 results.ÿ2. Pagination is not working as expected on the pop-up. The default results list showed only two records even though there were 4 Member Benefit records with the MBBG hold applied to them. Additionally, the """"Next"""" hyperlink was highlighted indicating that there are more results on the next page but when clicked, showed no results. - This will be handled in a separate defect <add defect ID>ÿ3. The default search results are expected to display, when the search icon is clicked and the pop-up window is open, without having to click on the filter button. The default search results were not displaying correctly. This has already been fixed by Samakshi.ÿÿ4. When testing the Search pop-up, QE found that the utility will display Member Benefits that have the MBBG hold applied to them, even if the hold is not active. However, the Bill Group Invoice Hold column in the search results display does indicate if the hold is active or not. Is this the intended functionality of the pop-up OR are we to only display Member Benefit records that have active MBBG holds applied to them in the default list of results? - Pam confirmed that the results should only display active holds and this change will be made in this defect.

DE709202,(Converted to UserStory) Returning past policies in 271 from CIRRUS.,"US5779976Issue here is:When providers are submitting 270 with process dates, for instance(20211209-20221209), then 271 is returning only past policies inspite of having active coverages. It is because, for mentioned dates we are having 2 policies (plans) with same bundle optionId, i.e. one is expired and other one is renewed PFA Ss.Somehow CIRRUS business logic is picking only first record(expired) and returning in 271. We have raised tasks to CIRRUS and they involved Account Implementation team to merge this planOptions as its setup or configuration issue.They have come up saying that they can merge the records only when planOption and BundleOptionId are same, hence they as well told that this cannot done from their end.

The UAF form includes important information that underwriting uses when auditing the groups year over year. In Cirrus all large lob groups are required to have a Member Group Contract Plan Option Reporting Code listed bases on what the group has selected on the UAF. The current process is to just add the 100U Active option to all groups because the data is not available in OBM. This is causing incorrect reporting codes to be listed on many group impacting thousands of members that are not tied to the correct reporting code. Product entered by customer: Cirrus, OBMÿPer Stephanie RobinsonI was able to pull the data from 2022 for the volumes. This is the volume of membership that needed to be reviewed and edited due to the UCR not being loaded correctly in Cirrus.

There used to be a field in the UI that was required and was for the version of the Contract Option. This was removed, but the back end logic is still looking at the CO version at the time of the event creation vs the most recent.

Should be pulling from most recent active.ÿSteps to reproduce:A Member Group with a Contract and Contract Option being built manually with memGroupContractOpt is at version 1a Member group Event and the corresponding actionEvent is created. the Contract Option static ID is provided on the Member Group Event.The contract option is subsequently versioned, validated and activated (so it's currently version 2)The Member Group Action Event is processed.Actual Results: The action event is not processed since the memGroupContractOptID mentioned on the event is staleÿExpected Results: The process should take into consideration the highest active version of the Contract Option and process the action event.ÿSolution:ÿThis solution will need to be implemented for the below Member group Action Event Schedule Job listed:If the contractOptID specified on the memGroupEvent is not the highest version, then get the highest versionIf highest version is active, process Events using this version.

Update action event to store PK and static plan option IDIf not found, update the action event status to ?Cancel without execution (X)?If a new plan option was added to the highest version, then case install will need to create a new Member Group Event. Assumption is that these instructions are available in existing SOPs.Add logic to update the Member Group Event Status to ?Close? if all action events are either in (C) complete, (X) canceled with execution, (CWE) complete with errors statuses.Add logic to the below Member group events such that if a Member Group Event already exists with the same contractOptID (static) and a new one is created with the same information, then the OLD one will be ClosedÿNew BusinessOff-Cycle Plan ChangeStopLossRate GuaranteeNote that this logic already exists for AST, RST and Migration Member group events.

DE699262,Bill Group Not Persisted For Specific Timeline in Subsaffiliation Screens,"JT - 2 problems:1. Different contractOptTypes. When a vision BG ran through, it found an overlapping dentalÿBGÿand deletedÿit. Solution is to incorporate contractOptType into the BG logic properly2.ÿWhen there are multiple inbound (derived or supplied) bill groups that overlap an existing record, we are incorrectly trying to adjust and keep the existing record twice. We create a copy of the existing record that is valid for each of the inbound timelines separately, and try to persist both. When this runs through the bill group lookup logic, we have problems. Solution is to properly bump the incoming and existing full timelines together instead of treating each inbound record as a wholly separate entity.Fix is available on cirrus-core branchÿdefect/jthibode/DE699262_fix_existing_bg_persistance_for_multiple_contractOptTypesÿComment from Justin Thibodeau:ÿÿWithout digging to deep, it seems to be another instance of the problem seen by DE691033 / DE653287 / US4873609 but this time caused by multiple benefit timelines. Momina tested sending the 2 timelines of benefits in separate transactions as well and saw the same result (BG 1 derives but doesn?t properly persist).ÿMomina's Findings:System is not persisting the derived Bill group for a specific timeline in the members subs affiliations screen. System is logically deleting the existing derived Bill group when a new Bill group is getting added with next timelines.

The assumption is that because there are multiple threads that can retrieve records from Kafka, that thread A picked up a record, checked the memGroupInvoice table to see if the record existed (which it didn't at that time). ÿThread A was slow to process the record and respond to kafka so thread B pickec up the same record. ÿThread B did the same validation check in the memGroupInvoice table, but because thread A was still processing the record it passed the validatiob check and eventually both threads A and B inserted the same record into the memGroupInvoice (and child) tables. ÿWe either need to check the other threads that are processing to see if they have the same record in it or move the validation check to be immediately before inserting the record into the memGroupInvoice table.ÿSteps to Recreate:Post message to Kafka (the kafka instance that BRMS posts Premium Paid Through payloads to)Create a system processing delay so that multiple threads pick up the same recordThis occurs when Thread A picks up a record and doesn't respond back to Kafka in X seconds and Kafka marks the record as available again and another Thread picks up the same record.Expected Result:The record being processed will only be saved once in the memGroupInvoice (and child) table.The following error will be logged to the Member Group Error Queue with the transaction type: """"Member Group Invoice Premium Paid Thru"""":""""ERR883929 -ÿFor transaction: {0}, a duplicate invoice was found with the same identifying attributes: recordType: {1}, invoiceIdentifier: {2}, messageTimeStamp: {3}, and invoiceCreateDateTime: {4}.""""ÿActual Result:The record being processed is being saved multiple times in the memGroupInvoice (and child) table.No errors are being logged in the Member Group Error Queue.ÿTechnical Notes:For this defect, the validation check was kept at the beginning of the process when the thread first picks up the record and a second validation was added to the end of the process, just before the thread loads the record into the memGroupInvoice table. ÿWhen triggered, first validation check will be able to log the transaction ID in the error message. ÿIf the second (new validation check that was added in this defect) validation check is triggered it will no longer have the transaction ID in context so that field will be blank in the error message. ÿFor testing purposes, this is how we can definitively know that we have triggered the second validation check as opposed to the first.ÿAdditional Information:Three groups - impacted -ÿGroup 1466887ÿ1416560 & 1462302 (these will be fixed by prod support and documented in an INC).ÿWe added a duplicate check into the Premium Paid Through process (US4631495) last year. ÿThe logic was to error if we get multiple records with the same:InvoiceIdentifier in the payload =ÿÿ memGroupInvoice.extInvoiceID ANDInvoiceCreateDateTime in the payload =ÿmemGroupInvoice.InvoiceRunDate ANDmessageTimestamp in the payload =ÿmemGroupInvoice.messageTimestampÿANDrecordType in the payload =ÿmemGroupInvoice.extRecordTypeÿ",QIB - Shazam,05-04-2023,Closed,3-Medium,,Design/Code Change,Customer Reported,882dfec51b46a9d487dec8415b4bcb03,,Incident,Srishti Rustagi,validation / code issue,2023.PI45.3,Accepted,21-08-2023

If the user doesn?t touch the field, it will default to persist today?s date into the db. The UI will display todays date when retrieving the record, regardless of what is in the db. We currently use this field in member event service determining when retro events took place for benefit transactions to then notify claims team to reprocess those claims. Since that field is not a valid source of truth, we need to either fix it to become reliable, or we need to pick another field that could be used by the member event service rule evaluations. One option is to use the date value of changeDateTime. Another option is the transaction date time stamps on the meta data of the member event, however this already has its flaws today and doesn?t always send a value.ÿWe have 3 options to proceed here:Fix the lastEnrollmentTransactionDate to be a reliable source of truthValidate that the date saved must be todays dateMake this a read only field in the UI and ignored when sent in as something other than today via EDI (I?m not sure what side effects this could have though)Pick a different field as our source of truth for retro benefit rule evaluationschangeDateTime is one optionor the transaction date time stamp on the meta data of the member event (would need further code changes to rely on this field)Or any others ideas?Or both (if both, its probably separate defects)ÿI am not sure the best solution for this, and we?ll possibly need a combination of business and tech input.

Count in Echo for covLevelCode = SPC is 0In the Echo environment, the configuration of the standard Family Unit and Relationship Schedules also look to be configured correctly.ÿIn the Alpha environment, there's only 3 Member Groups associated to Member Group Contract Plan Bill Rate records configured to use a Billing Schedule that ties back to the Family Unit Schedule of 4T_SUB_DBL_TPL_FAM. None of these Member Group have any members in them; a query of the subsAffiliation table using these Member Group IDs yields zero members.See Member Groups: 1359247, 1360227, and 1367929.Next Steps:In Alpha, add a Member Group configured similar to 1359247, 1360227, or 1367929 but having current Member Group Contract Options and Plan Options, and ensure that the Plan Options tie back to a Bill Rate that maps to the Family Unit Schedule of 4T_SUB_DBL_TPL_FAMAdd a family to the Member Group consisting of 1 Subscriber, 1 Spouse, and 1 Dependent Child while ensuring that the Member Benefit they're enrolled into ties back to the correctly configured Plan Option (as described above)Confirm that the Coverage Level Code for this family unit is SPC after the installation is complete. ÿIf this is true, then this defect can be closed.ÿ- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -ÿ",Ronin,15-03-2023,Closed,3-Medium,Test,Not a Defect,Internally Reported,,,,Pam Heuer,,,Accepted,05-12-2023

DE688898,PCP Randomization on NexusACO members post 60-day grace period.,"Brief DescriptionThis set of defects - check with Dave H. that these are truly two separate issues -- revolves around two PCP-random assignment issues. This defect will work to explore the cause and solution for each issue, as well a determine whether they are related.ÿÿSummary: NexusACO Member receives correct warning that they have a grace period before they are assigned a PCP. An your later, the Members has been assigned a PCP.ÿIssue 1:ÿ When invoking randomization, the message below appears. It is as if the system does not recognize the 60-day grace period has passed nor does it provide any indication the randomization function is underway.The second issue deals with those working the error queue or attempting to resolve PCP assignment issues. The warning message mistakenly suggests the user has done something wrong.ÿÿÿAfter waiting an hour, the randomization was complete and assigned a PCP.ÿÿIdeally, the user should receive an acknowledgement message that randomization is in process, and it may take an hour to complete. The user should not receive the warning message above.ÿÿThere are a couple conditions that could cause random PCP assignment to not be delayedIf the Benefit effective date + the OAP were to equal to a date less than or equal to current date....the record would be written to MAE table and picked up in the next hourly runif the plan although NexusACO aligned did not have a OAP set....it would be treated like a """"regular"""" randomization requestbeneTierNetworkProvDetail of the member plan ÿhas to be set up with OAP and OAP Duration TypeÿÿSummary: Random PCP assignment is repeatedly unsuccessful.ÿIssue2:ÿ While analyzing a report which identifies NexusACO OA members without a PCP, Jason Merckling and I were trying to invoke PCP randomization to validate the steps an enrollment specialist would take to resolve missing PCP. Jason was unable to invoke randomization on any of the test members. Below is an example of a member where an attempt to randomization was made.ÿÿAttached to the INC is a list of members without a PCP assignment, post 60-day grace period.Note Column AR: In the sample of members checked (highlighted in yellow) two members had a PCP assignment, either through randomization or self-selected.",Heimdalls,14-03-2023,Closed,3-Minor Problem,,Converted,Customer Reported,cfe7dac61bade15423f1ca661a4bcb18,,Incident,Ben Miller,converted to a user story - US5058552,2023.PI46.1,Accepted,29-08-2023

The Transaction table shows that SAMx submitted duplicate memGroupLoad payloads within a second of each other.2.

There is a validation preventing duplicate records on the UI, but it seems like this is not extended to API installs4. The Contract Option is validating successfully but upon activation, it is running into this application error.

Contract option validation applies a check to ensure the stop loss and entity reserve periods are in alignment for a given contract option period. However, it appears this check is validating for all historical SL and ER periods, instead of the periods that fall within the contract option timeline.As can be seen below, the SL and ER periods are aligned for the new contract option timeline. However, it appears the validation is check SL and ER periods that fall outside the range of the contract option. The check should only compare the SL and ER periods that fall within the CO timeline.If there is a partial overlap with the Stoploss and Entity Reserve timelines with the Contract Option timeline, then they will be considered when adding/ updating the Stoploss and Entity Reserve assignment for the Plan Option.The validation will check to ensure that the stoploss and ER timelines match.ÿEnvironment: MasterÿMaster Example: Member Group: 1422655Contract option period 2/1/2023 - 1/31/2024Plan Options PO100003 and PO100004Stoploss policyÿperiod 2/1/2023 - 1/31/2024Entity Reserve periodÿ2/1/2023 - 1/31/2024ÿSteps to reproduce:1.

Unfortunately, there are lot of transactions being missed and not sent to COM360 for document generation. COM360 is receiving a lot of emails from the customers about their missing benefit documents. Because of this gap in Cirrus, COM360 is not able to meet the compliance requirements to fulfill SBC's and COC's as per the federal guidelines.For some groups events has been created but not action event created for the group. For some groups, even the group event has not been created.Attached the snapshots to explain the above issue. and the groups that missed the automatic triggering event from Cirrus.https://uhgazure.sharepoint.com/sites/SBI/PRIMEOperations/USP%20Fulfillment%20Reporting%20BCM/Forms/AllItems.aspxIn the above link, the daily report has the transactions being missed and not sent to COM360 for document generation.ÿSA Notes after analyzingÿattached spreadsheet.The defect has about 103 Member Groups with different gaps or issues(in attached spreadsheet). I did some spot checking on some of these groups and found:Event was created but Contract was subsequently cancelled.Event was created but no actionEvent was createdEvent was created but the Contract Option was versioned or plan option was deleted ? this was also what Gomathi found in her analysis of the spreadsheet.Also, we did a recent spike (this one I think, US5349499) that closed out action events where the plan option was deleted after actionEvent creation. I think this is the reason some of the Action Events are in ?Closed without Execution? status. It also looks like some of them were manually closed out by other users.Gomathi pointed out that these PGAs are often raised for multiple groups/ plan options where it?s hard to pin down the scope as there are many issues across the groups submitted in the ticket (See related email attached titled ?FW:Defect Question?).ÿ",QIB - Rogue,18-01-2023,Closed,3-Medium,Production,Design/Code Change,Customer Reported,ba36f3141b2cad1867af32af034bcbff,,Incident,Logan Fabyanske,,2023.PI44.3,Accepted,08-05-2023
